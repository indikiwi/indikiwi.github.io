Hey person on the internet,

This is my website! Or as I like to call it, webkiwi. I just thought of that.

In recent times, I have had a lot of thought on my relation with the internet, its value and how I want to have it in my life.
If you know me (you probably do), you know I have been trying to cut social media, reduce phone usage and go more analog (?). This has its ups and downs, as I sometimes just really want
to look at TikTok as I feel like nothing else can replace that feeling honestly of seeing the kind of stuff you see on TikTok. OK, at this point I have given up on writing my thoughts
in a eloquent way, I'll try a little bit. I like Instagram just for seeing stories of my friends, there used to be a seperate app called Instagram Threads (they used the name again for
their Twitter thing), which only had the Stories and DM features and it was great. Now sometimes when I look at Instagram stories of my friends, I algorithmically and marketingly fall into
the trap of looking at reels of........ I don't know honestly, it's like I get hypnotized and I cannot remember. Atleast TikTok still has like funny, niche and directly catering to _me_ content.

Anyway. I saw some videos pop up on my YouTube about the indie personal web. When I was a kid spending way way too much time on my mini-laptop,
I also did make some websites of my own using Weebly or something, but they were pretty insignificant. Back then, I feel like the web was a lot more genuine and there wasn't necessary
a need for me to fork a whole GitHub repository and write a post in the GitHub web-based editor because I'm too lazy to open VS code. I would just go on Tumblr. Maybe in a couple of years I'll
also look back on this and think it's cringe haha.

I also saw Mina Le's recent video and it resonated a lot with me. As a former kid addicted to the web and now adult (that's crazy) in rehab. I forgot where I was going with that, but
I kind of like the sentence so I'm keeping it. It's my web! So I won't kill my darlings! I think it feels really good to use my writing as it is and not try to make it look
really good or anything. I've been writing academically for my seminar and soon for my thesis :(, and writing something and asking ChatGPT to write it better academically is surpressing
my personal writing style...... Of course I don't ask LLM to improve my personal Moleskine written in murasaki-shikibu fountain pen I got in Japan, but that is just for myself. This feels more
for, someone else. A person on the internet. Maybe only Maura. I think it would be fun to share it with my friends, but it also feels a little bit embarassing. Like who is even still blogging
these days... None of y'all even want to reply to my cf stories.... (this is semi-sarcastic) What happened to using the internet for fun sharing personal stuff with friends? 

Digitally Yours,
kiwi
